i really dont think i give a fuck.
ppl are liars. ppl cannot be trusted.
there must be something in the coolaid because everyone is the fucking same        
ppl are de-evolving and prove themselves to be worth very little of my time and attention
dad was right
no one is entertaining
no one is educating
so, i guess, everyone can just fuck off.
i can't be arsed doing anything right now
if there wasnt a meaningless exam, id go home and fucken lift shit
where the hell can i find an opportunity to be.. to feel worthwhile.
i thought writing a book would hep, get published, feel accomplished.
well brad fucked that right up, eh?

there's persistence, but then there's stupidity

constantly getting back up after failure, is one thing
constantly 'coming back' after rejection?
yeah, that's fucken stupid
and this place is a petri dish of rejection
for someone like me

fuck it's funny still being able to instil feelings of such... cowardice in ppl. true or not, it doesn't matter
